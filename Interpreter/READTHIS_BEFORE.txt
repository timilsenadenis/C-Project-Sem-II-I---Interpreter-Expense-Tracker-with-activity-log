.........This project can only handle arthematic operation (+,-,*,/,%[MOD]).
.........This Arthematic interpreter can take input from user using 'INPUT' keyword and Display using 'PRINT'.
.........This is the first version of the project, along with time we will update it.  
                               
                     Example:                    
                                INPUT a
                                INPUT b
                                c=a+b*b
                                PRINT c
                                END
                                RUN
                    
         This example will take two input from user, perform arthematic operation and the result will be display as output.
